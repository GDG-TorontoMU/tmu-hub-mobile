# TMU Hub Mobile: Open Source Mobile App Project

Welcome to the TMU Hub Mobile project! This initiative follows the Clean Architecture model and uses the BLoC pattern for state management. This guide will help you set up, develop, and contribute to the mobile app built with Flutter.

## Overview

TMU Hub Mobile is a cross-platform application built with Flutter. Crafted with Clean Architecture principles, the code is divided into layers to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability. We use the BLoC pattern to manage business logic and state. Whether you’re new to mobile development or an experienced developer, this guide is your starting point.

## Key Features

- **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns with layered design (Domain, Data, Presentation).
- **BLoC State Management:** Efficient handling of business logic using the BLoC pattern.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Clean, responsive, and intuitive design.
- **API Integration:** Seamless connection with backend services.
- **Testing:** Unit, widget, and integration tests to ensure quality.
- **Modular Codebase:** Organized project structure that simplifies development and scaling.

## Technology Stack

- **Flutter & Dart:** For building natively compiled apps.
- **BLoC:** To implement robust state management and business logic separation.
- **HTTP Clients:** Use HTTP or Dio libraries for API communication.
- **Testing:** Utilize flutter_test and bloc_test for comprehensive testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (latest stable version)
- A modern code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code or Android Studio)
- An iOS Simulator, Android Emulator, or a physical device

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/tmu-hub-mobile.git
    cd tmu-hub-mobile
    ```

2. **Install Flutter Dependencies:**
    Install necessary packages with:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Configure Your Environment:**
    If the app requires custom environment settings (like API endpoints), create and update a configuration file (e.g., `config.dart`):
    ```dart
    // config.dart
    class Config {
      static const String apiUrl = "http://localhost:5000";
    }
    ```
    Adjust these settings according to your development environment.

4. **Run the App:**
    Launch the app on your emulator or connected device:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    For hot reloading during development, use:
    ```bash
    flutter run --hot
    ```

### Building for Production

Generate production builds with one of the following commands:
- For Android:
  ```bash
  flutter build apk
  ```
- For iOS (requires macOS):
  ```bash
  flutter build ios
  ```

### Running Tests

Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality:
```bash
flutter test
```

## Project Structure

Following Clean Architecture, the project is organized into distinct layers:
